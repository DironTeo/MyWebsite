Welcome to my website!

I'm glad you're here. I'm passionate into game and software development. Right now, I've tried to worked on a variety of projects. This website is a personal project that I've been working on in my spare time to showcase all of that project. 

It's still under development, but I'm hoping to add new features and content in the future. I'm particularly will work on anything such as Python, Flutter, Django, SQLite and etc.

I'm always looking for feedback, so please don't hesitate to let me know what you think. You can leave a comment below or contact me through my contact page.

Thank you for visiting and reading!

Sincerely,
Amirul Ashraf (Diron Teo)
